        <h1>CSS Comments</h1>

        <p>
            CSS allows for comments, which are essential for documenting your stylesheets,
            explaining complex rules, or temporarily disabling parts of your code.
            CSS comments are very similar to C/C++ comments, surrounded by <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code>.
        </p>

        <h2>Basic Comment Syntax</h2>

        <h3>Single-Line Comments</h3>
        <p>
            Comments can be placed on a single line. Everything between <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code> is ignored by the browser.
        </p>
        <pre><code>/* This is a CSS comment */
.single-line-comment {
    color: #e63946; /* This is a CSS comment for the color property */
    font-weight: bold;
}</code></pre>
        <div class="single-line-comment">This text is styled by a rule with a single-line comment.</div>

        <h3>Multi-Line Comments</h3>
        <p>
            Comments can span multiple lines. The comment starts with <code>/*</code> and ends with <code>*/</code>,
            regardless of how many lines are in between.
        </p>
        <pre><code>/* This is a CSS comment, and it
   can be several lines long without
   any problem whatsoever.
*/
.multi-line-comment {
    background-color: #a8dadc;
    padding: 10px;
    border-radius: 5px;
}</code></pre>
        <div class="multi-line-comment">This box is styled by a rule with a multi-line comment.</div>

        <h2>Important Restrictions: No Nested Comments</h2>
        <p>
            It’s crucial to remember that CSS comments <strong>cannot be nested</strong>. A comment block ends at the
            first <code>*/</code> it encounters. If you try to nest comments, it will break your stylesheet.
        </p>

        <h3>Incorrect Example: Nested Comments</h3>
        <p>
            This example demonstrates what happens when you try to nest comments. The "outside" comment
            will terminate prematurely at the closing of the "inside" comment, causing the rest of the
            intended comment block to be treated as active CSS rules (or syntax errors).
        </p>
        <pre><code>/* This is a comment, in which we find
   another comment, which is WRONG
   /* Another comment */ &lt;-- This closes the outer comment prematurely!
   and back to the first comment, which is not a comment.*/
.nested-comment-issue {
    color: red; /* This line is also commented out by the broken block */
}</code></pre>
        <div class="warning">
            <strong>WARNING:</strong> The CSS rule for <code>.nested-comment-issue</code> is intended to be commented out
            in the example code block above, but due to the incorrect nested comment syntax, only the portion
            up to the first <code>*/</code> is actually commented. This means the <code>.nested-comment-issue</code>
            rule will likely not be applied as intended, or may cause parsing errors.
            (This specific example class is not applied to any element on this page to avoid visual confusion).
        </div>

        <p>
            One common way to accidentally create "nested" comments is to temporarily comment out a large block of
            a stylesheet that already contains a comment. Since CSS doesn’t permit nested comments, the "outside"
            comment will end where the "inside" comment ends.
        </p>

        <h2>Comments on the Same Line as Styles</h2>
        <p>
            Unlike some other languages (e.g., JavaScript's <code>//</code> or Python's <code>#</code>), CSS does not
            have a "rest of the line" comment pattern. The only comment pattern is <code>/* */</code>.
            Therefore, if you wish to place comments on the same line as markup, you need to be careful about how you
            place them, ensuring each line or segment of comment is properly wrapped.
        </p>

        <h3>Correct Way to Comment on Multiple Lines Alongside Styles</h3>
        <p>
            Each line of the comment must be explicitly wrapped in <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code>.
        </p>
        <pre><code>.correct-same-line {
    color: #457b9d; /* This CSS comment is on the same line */
    background-color: #f1faee; /* as the declaration, and each line */
    padding: 8px; /* needs its own comment markers. */
    border: 1px solid #1d3557; /* This ensures all styles are applied. */
}</code></pre>
        <div class="correct-same-line">This box is styled correctly, with comments alongside each property.</div>

        <h3>Incorrect Way to Comment on Multiple Lines Alongside Styles</h3>
        <p>
            If each line isn't marked off, most of the stylesheet will become part of the comment and thus will not work.
        </p>
        <pre><code>.incorrect-same-line {
    color: #a7c957; /* This CSS comment is several lines
    background-color: #f2e8cf; /* long, but since it is not wrapped
    padding: 8px; /* in comment markers, the last three
    border: 1px solid #283618; /* styles are part of the comment. */
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            In the example above, only the <code>color</code> property will be applied to <code>.incorrect-same-line</code>.
            The rest of the rules (<code>background-color</code>, <code>padding</code>, <code>border</code>), being part of the
            unclosed comment, are ignored by the browser’s rendering engine.
        </p>
        <div class="incorrect-same-line">
            This box should have a light yellow background, padding, and a dark border,
            but only its text color is applied due to the broken comment in the CSS.
        </div>

        <div class="note">
            <strong>NOTE:</strong> CSS comments are treated by the CSS parser as if they do not exist at all,
            and so do not count as whitespace for parsing purposes. This means you can even put them
            into the middle of rules—even right inside declarations!
        </div>
        <p>
            For example, this is valid CSS, though not commonly used for readability:
        </p>
        <pre><code>.comment-inside-declaration {
    font-size: /* This comment is inside the value */ 20px;
    line-height: 1.5;
    text-decoration: underline /* This comment is after the value */;
    border: 2px solid /* Comment before value */ #e76f51;
}</code></pre>
        <div class="comment-inside-declaration">
            This text demonstrates comments placed inside CSS declarations.
        </div>
    </div>

</body>
</html>
